# bytecuts
Reference implementation for the ByteCuts packet classifier.

ByteCuts is able to read files generated by the ClassBench packet classifier.

A sample rule list and trace file have been included.

A sample bash script, classify.sh, has been provided that demonstrates running the algorithm on a given rule list and packet trace including how to set the parameters that ByteCuts uses (these are set to the default values).

There is also a second utility that can compare the results from several different algorithms to ensure that they all give the same results.  This helps check that all of the classifiers are behaving correctly.  In the result of disagreement, it performs a linear search of the rule list to establish the ground truth.
